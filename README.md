# python-programs

Python programs is the repository where I keep all my python programs.

I learned python using https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python
and completed all the tutorials between July 28th and August 5th, 2018. I did this after I took all
the CS124, CS165, and CS235 at Brigham Young University - Idaho.
